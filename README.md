WHAT IS THE PROJECT?

RESPONSIVE PORTFOLIO WEBSITE

The Responsive Portfolio Website is a training project to build responsive website with SCSS. It was my goal to build well functioning portfolio website for myself. It shows different part of my knowledge, experience, projects and contact information. It works with larger and smaller screens.


HOW TO INSTALL AND RUN IT?

You can install the project by opening the terminal on your computer and running the command:
git clone https://github.com/Omat-projektit/lut-project.git

Then to install the node_modules run the command:

Now you can read the code and make changes. On my behalf you're welcome to use the code, but I ask you not to push any changes to my repository.
